<h2>MY INTEREST IN IT</h2>

<p>My interest in IT started quite young, tinkering with a Pentium 100 with 2 Mg Ram and 20 Mg HDD. I spent hours playing Wolfenstein 3D with no sound card, drank lots of coffee and generally had an awesome time.  In that era that was all DOS based, which was very interesting and basic.  I then upgraded to a better PC, the specs I can’t remember sorry but it ran Windows 95 and I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread.  At this time the internet was something you used with a 28800 modem, I can still remember the noise it made connecting………

I then started building my own PC’s, playing more advanced games and then cable internet was connected to the house.  My first bill was $1000 for the month, the wife WAS NOT VERY HAPPY! Needless to say the internet was monitored very closely from that point forward.

I found that building and networking PC’s the most interesting facet of IT. It was always a competition to have the best PC on the block! I ran a LAN club for a few years where I would get a group of about 15 guys come round and we would all plug in and play games, snags and sauce in bread at lunch time, and then back to it for another couple of hours.

I chose RMIT because of it being ranked in the top 250 universities in the world. RMIT is globally recognized for its qualities and has a reputation for excellence in education. It is renowned for creating life changing experiences for its students and the leadership and support shown is second to none.

<p> The NETWORK DESIGN ENGINEER – MAJOR BANKS, also commonly known as network architect, is a position that interests me greatly. This is a role that is instrumental in designing networks with an emphasis on security and risks associated with the design, system configuration, implementation, and the stability of the system.  This position appeals to me as it is quite a great challenge to project manage such a large development within a significant company.  You would have to be extremely proficient in networking capabilities with an emphasis on security systems and firewall management and implementation.  I currently have limited knowledge of networking and security within large corporations therefore to gain these skills I would need to have completed my degree, and worked in the field of networking and security for a minimum of 7 years.  Further study would be required as there is a need for knowledge on project management and design, core switching, routing technologies and security. The need for knowledge on networks such as local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), intranets and extranets would be required and experience in these would be essential for success. By participating in educational opportunities and maintaining your personal network of colleagues can assist this greatly along with being associated with professional organizations.  I love the idea of having the need for substantial attention to detail as everything must be perfectly implemented and maintained in order for the business to run smoothly combined with the integrity of the infrastructure, enabling the users to gain maximum performance from the equipment being used, is of utmost importance as would be the security of the system. The documentation and enforcement of system standards and protocols by monitoring performance and access is one of the fundamental basics required to ensure system integrity and security.</p>


<h4><b> LEARNING STYLES </b></h4>

<p>Very interesting things I found out about myself!</p>

<h5>,<b>JUNG & Myer Briggs</b></h5>
<h6>ENFJ Learning Style</h6>
<h7>How ENFJs acquire, memorize and recollect information</h7>

<p>ENFJ’s interest in a subject is driven by the answer to the question, “Is this helpful to people?” The more they see a topic to be beneficial to others, the greater their interest in the topic and the greater their desire to actively engage in it and apply what they learn. Their interest in studying the material is motivated by their desire to find solutions to people-related issues.</p>
<p>ENFJs easily and quickly pick up new material, especially when it is delivered on a conceptual basis. Concrete information is also well received by individuals of this type. ENFJs are capable of grasping material lacking strong logical connection. For example, learning the rules of the road is no more difficult for them than grasping some theory. As a rule, they develop a great depth and breadth of understanding of new material. Learned material is better retained when a significant portion of it is devoted to highlighting the topic’s connection and relevance to people.</p>
<p>ENFJs are capable of independently learning expansive and complex material. They are good at both retention of information on a logical basis and mechanical memorization, although the latter is less effective. ENFJs are able to precisely recall learned information, whether or not it is all conceptually related. ENFJs can benefit from studying both independently and in a group setting.</p>
<p>ENFJs are able to actively apply acquired knowledge and skills to their work. They can apply it to concrete tasks or creatively develop it in a given direction. Working with material they have learned, understood, and internalized brings them great enjoyment.</p>
<p>ENFJs are able to remain very stable when experiencing a high level of learning related stress. They prefer to evenly distribute their efforts in learning new material, although they are capable of learning through short periods of overexertion.</p>

<h8>Your Type Preferences</h8>

<p>Extravert(56%) iNtuitive(9%) Feeling(22%) Judging(6%)</p> 

<h9>AN ENFJ’s LEARNING IS IMPROVED WHEN:</h9>

 
<p>•	Material is of great interest to many people</p>
<p>•	Active learning methods such as debates, brainstorming and contests are used</p>
<p>•	Learning is systematic (e.g., an organized degree or certification program)</p>
<p>•	Material is delivered at a fast pace, as ENFJs quickly sort and process information</p>
<p>•	Material is delivered from various viewpoints or using various examples (improves retention)</p>
<p>•	Their successes and achievements are recognized by others</p>


<h10>AN ENFJ’s LEARNING IS HINDERED WHEN:<h/10>
 
<p>•	They do not consider the material to be of personal importance</p>
<p>•	The material studied is insufficient to make them proficient on the topic (reduces interest)</p>
<p>•	The material is of purely practical and mundane nature</p>

<h11><b>VISUAL LEARNER</b></h11>

<p>Visual learners learn best when information is presented in a written language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams. If you are a visual learner, the suggestions that follow can help you to succeed in school to the best of your ability.</P>

<p>•	Create graphic organizers such as diagrams and concept maps that use visual symbols to represent ideas and information.</p>
<p>•	When trying to remember information, close your eyes and visualize the information. Include illustrations as you take notes in class.</p>
<p>•	Use highlighter pens of contrasting colours to colour code different aspects of the information in your textbooks.</p>
<p>•	Sit in the front of the class so that you can clearly see the teacher. This will allow you to pick up facial expressions and body language that provides cues that what your teacher is saying is important to write in your notes.</p>
<p>•	Study in a place that is free from visual distractions.</p>
<p>•	When using flashcards, limit the amount of information on a card so that you can form a mental picture of the information.</p>
<p>•	Watch videos about topics you are studying in class.</p>
<p>•	When hearing a new word you want to remember, visualize its spelling. When reviewing information, rewrite or draw the information from memory. When taking notes, replace words with symbols wherever possible.</p>
<p>•	Type your written notes from class using different fonts, bold print, and underlining to make the most important concepts and facts visually apparent.</p>
<p>•	When solving math problems that involve a sequence of steps, draw a series of boxes, each containing the appropriate piece of information in sequence.</p>

<h13><b>KINESTHETIC LEARNING AND YOU</b></h13>
<h14><b>KINESTHETIC IS YOUR PRIMARY LEARNING STYLE.</b></h14>
<img src="Kin_Graph.jpg">

<p>Kinesthetic style is learning by doing. You learn in this manner whenever you capture new information through the process of physical activity. It is often referred to as hands- on learning experience. Consider how you learned to ride a bicycle. You learned by getting on a bike to experience and practice balancing, steering and pedalling. This experience ultimately taught you how to ride.</p>

<h15><b>CHARACTERISTICS OF A KINESTHETIC LEARNER</b></h15)


<p>•	Good at learning through hands-on experience</p>
<p>•	Often bored with traditional textbook learning</p>
<p>•	Likes to move around and explore their environment</p>
<p>•	Usually enjoys athletics and physical education</p> 
<p>•	Likes to touch objects and people</p>
<p>•	Would rather participate than watch</p>
<p>•	Appreciates opportunities to go on field trips</p> 
<p>•	Gets satisfaction from building with their hands</p>
<p>•	Enjoys classes with physical experiments</p>
<p>•	Can become restless without physical activity</p>


<h16><b>VISUAL LEARNING AND YOU</b></h16)
<h17><b>VISUAL IS YOUR SECONDARY LEARNING STYLE.</b></h17)
<img src="Vis_Graph.jpg">

<p>Visual style is learning by seeing. You learn visually whenever you gain information from sight. This includes more than just the viewing of pictures and your surroundings. Visual learning also encompasses the written word. Visual learners benefit greatly from teaching that utilizes illustrations, charts, diagrams, videos, etc. They often feel a need to convert spoken instruction into visual form by taking notes.</p>

<h18><b>CHARACTERISTICS OF A KINESTHETIC LEARNER</b></h18)


<p>•	Good at remembering people's faces</p>
<p>•	Accurately recognizes body language and facial expressions</p>
<p>•	Able to picture things in their mind</p>
<p>•	Good at taking notes in the form of text and doodles</p>
<p>•	Comprehends visual information such as charts, graphs and diagrams</p>
<p>•	Recalls appearances with ease</p>
<p>•	Appreciates pictures and illustrations in books Enjoys learning from video presentations Learns well from flash cards</p>
<p>•	Notices visual details that others might miss</p>


<h19><b>MY LEARNING STYLES</b></h19>
<h20><b>VIA 3 DIFFERENT REPORTS BASED ON LEARNING STYLES, I HAVE DISCOVERED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACETS TO MY LEARNING CAPABILITIES</b></h20>

<p><b>POSITIVES</b></p>

<p>I’ve discovered that I like to help people and the more that I can see that it is beneficial to them the more I strive to assist them, assisting in any way to assist in finding solutions to their problems</P>
<p>I learn and retain information better when the material is related to assisting people and is delivered in a more concrete and conceptual basis</P>
<p>I can benefit from learning independently or in a group setting and have good retention of information on a logical basis.</P>
<p>I can actively apply acquired knowledge to my work which gives me enjoyment.</P>
<p>I can handle stressful situations and I can learn through short periods of overexertion.</P>
<p>My learning is improved when it is of interest to many people and I can quickly sort and process information.</P>
<p>Material delivered from different perspectives improves retention.</P>
<p>I also a more of a visual learner that benefits from being able to see what I’m learning in a format either written, pictures or diagrams.  I like things to be highlighted, in bold print and underlined to make the important things visually apparent.</P>


<p><b>NEGATIVES</b></P>
<p>I don’t retain information if I don’t think it to be of personal importance.</P>
<p>I don’t learn well if the material is boring.</P>
<p>The influences this may have on me during group work is that I want to ensure others succeed and I would assist them in any way I could, and if the project work we are undertaking is interesting to all involved in my group then it would definitely be of interest to me.</P>



<h21><b>PROJECT</b></h21>

<p>Currently Australia wide there is a prescription drug epidemic.  Those affected daily go from doctor to doctor obtaining prescriptions for drugs of dependence.  They call this “Doctor Shopping”, they then go to different chemists and fill their prescriptions daily getting a cache of drugs for their dependence.  The project concept would be a cloud based database that would have all chemists networked to it so as to determine when and if a person has filled a prescription.  In essence one chemist could see if another chemist had filled the same prescription for drugs of dependence on the same day, therefore avoiding the ability for people to stock up on their drugs of choice.</p>

<p>The statistics of prescription drug misuse is a worldwide epidemic and has increased significantly over the last 10 years. The 2013 National Drug Strategy Household Survey has determined through survey that 4.8% of Australians used pharmaceutical drugs for a recreational purpose, which is an increase of 3.8% since 2004. Prescription opioid’s increased from 7% in 2000 to 23% in 2015.  Analgesics and sedatives were the most common prescribed drugs used for recreation abuse, activating the reward system of the brain to give feelings of pleasure. Therefore to avoid the constant supply available to users, a live network between chemists must be installed to monitor the dispensing of medication to users.</p>

<p>The service would require all pharmacies to have a live internet connection linked to a secure cloud based server, hosted by a government monitoring agency.  Therefore all pharmacies would enter all prescriptions prior to being dispensed to patients.  This in turn would avoid the oversupply of pharmaceuticals to people for recreational misuse and stockpiling. This in turn would immediately limit the supply of drugs to users for recreational purposes or caching for later use, by red flagging to the pharmacist when oversupply is in occurrence. Then in turn, the abuse of pharmaceuticals would be reduced significantly in the community due to the restricted access. The features of the product would include cloud storage due to its 24x7 availability and is available globally. There would be enhanced alliance with the ability for all pharmacists to access the data available when and if required, ensuring the data is live and updated immediately.  Document control and security is one of the utmost important features of this system. It will track and ensure the correct supply of pharmaceuticals to patients, as the system is live and over supply will ultimately be reduced as chemists will be made aware that a prescription has just been filled by the customer already within the restricted timeframe. Real time recording of prescriptions through 24x7 up time, and immediate updating by pharmacies would be of the utmost importance to ensure the purpose of the system remains valid.  Project management of this venture would be of a massive scale, as currently there are more than 5,700 pharmacies in Australia alone.  The features required for this system to be viable are for secure software to be written, tested and implemented along with in-depth training for all involved from end users, installation engineers to support services would be essential. Documentation to be written including user manuals, installation manuals and support manuals would be of a requirement.  Service support with trouble shooting skills would be required 24x7 in the event there are problems with the system, as it must remain live at all times to continue to be effective in its application towards the reduction of drug misuse. Pharmacists can serve as the first line of defense in recognizing problematic patterns in prescription drug use combined with the use of the system which has been appropriately named “The Dependence Cork” based on stopping drug leaks into the community. It would not only be beneficial to many people to assist with a reduction in drug dependence, but also it would be a money saving venture, as funds saved on assisting prescription drug dependants would be reduced significantly.  The time wasted in doctors surgeries will also be reduced by people attending that are not actually there because they are sick, but just to gain their supply of dependent drugs.  It would be extremely interesting to see the impact that this would have on society in general, as this epidemic is quite real and not being monitored correctly by doctors and pharmacists who are at the coal face of these people’s addictions.</p>

<p>The infrastructure required would be secure linked computers in all pharmacies which would be mandatory through government legislation. This would require all pharmacies to invest in computers and secure internet connections that would connect to a cloud based service. Secure software development is a necessity as there would be extremely sensitive information with regards to patient needs. There is also a need for Wireless access routers or branch-office devices using centralized management in the cloud.  A monitoring agency would be required as we all know there are rogue pharmacists that will dispense anything to anyone! Manuals for all facets of the system would be required, from installation, maintenance and use of the software for end users.</p>

<p>Skills required for such a project are many.  Beginning with a team of project managers that have experience in all areas from network design, software development, computer installation with secure internet connections to cloud based networking.  The software to be developed must be secure and be able to red flag the misuse of pharmaceuticals to chemists so as to avoid recreational use.  The hardware would be on a massive scale as all pharmacies would require computers with secure network access to cloud based data bases. A secure data centre would be required and monitored continually.</p>

<p>The impact this would have on the community in its success would be massive, with an immediate reduction in the misuse of prescription drugs for recreational purposes.  People would only be able to fill prescriptions in the allotted time frame as set down by their doctor.  Pharmacists would be ultimately held responsible for drug distribution policies, and would be monitored with red flag software development to deter over supply. There would be less drug related overdoses and deaths within the community as over supply would cease and further this in turn would also reduce the use of doctors for unnecessary visits, freeing them up for actual patients in need of care.</p>
